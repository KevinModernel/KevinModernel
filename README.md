### Hi there 👋

My name is Kevin and I'm working to become a Full Stack Developer! I'm currently focused on learning Back End with NodeJS and Java, and using either SQL or NoSQL databases, upon the requirements of the project.

I've been coding as a hobby for some years, and since October 2022 I made the decision of changing my professional path from Mechanical Engineering to Software Development (finally I put my money where my mouth was :sweat_smile:), so here I am, spending a good part of the day coding and the rest of it reading documentation/StackOverFlow :blush:.

My projects until now are built with:

### Back End:
  - NodeJS
  - And its popular modules such as Express, Passport, Mongoose, Sequelize.

### Front End:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap
  - PUG
  - Vanilla JS
  - A little bit of jQuery

### DataBases:
  - PostgreSQL
  - MongoDB

### Testing:
  - Jest
  - SuperTest

And I'm working/studying TypeScrypt, Java and React.
